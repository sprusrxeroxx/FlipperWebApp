This is a project to help a local swimclub coach get easier access to the swim stats of all his swimmers.


He uses a smart watch to record the swimdata for a particular swimmer and automatically uploads it to his desktop.

Now the problem is that he has to draw the graph representation of the data by first creating a spreadsheet, and then creating  graph for each of his 20+ students.

So he's tasked me with helping him create a scalable means of doing this process as it gets more tedious everytime he has to do it himself.

So the idea is to build him a website where he can lookup any student's record and to get the associated graph.
